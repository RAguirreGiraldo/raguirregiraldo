## About me
Hi, I'm a person with some experience in the IT field. I'm currently returning to software development and I love to learn new things and keep myself updated.

I like challenges and I am always willing to be active to keep learning.

Reinventing yourself is not easy but it is with perseverance and discipline that great goals are achieved.
